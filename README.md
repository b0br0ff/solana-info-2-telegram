# solana-info-2-telegram
Shell script that uses Solana and Telegram REST API to send useful stats on a Solana node

## Why?
Solana node validators need to have information about balance on the main identity account, vote account and stake accounts, health of the validator. 

## How?
This script i written in pure linux shell, I have tested it only in Ubuntu 20/04 LTS. It also uses 2 modules bc and jq that might be not installed on your system by default. Install them if needed. In theory should work under any other Linux distribution. Does not require Solana CLI to be installed on the machine.
